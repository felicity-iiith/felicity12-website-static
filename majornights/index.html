					<p><span class="desc">&gt; We call it Confused Pop. Why “Confused”? We hope someone can help us solve that riddle soon. We suppose the confusion mostly comes in once you hear a mix of pop vocals, bluesy guitars, funk bass lines, melodic (and sometimes pompous) electronic layers carried along by progressive drums all combined in a heap of musical endeavors to form the sixth element that we like to call our own. Let the flower children take you for the Faridkot experience. It might just be a bumpy ride, but thats how all good things begin...right...</span></p>
